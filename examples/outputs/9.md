1. Added import of time module
2. A global variable start_time is initialized when the script is loaded, marking the start of the server.
3. A new endpoint /uptime is added to calculate and return how long the server has been running. The uptime is calculated by subtracting start_time from the current time, and the result is formatted into hours, minutes, and seconds.
